# Hello!

I'm Philippa, an Animation Programmer based in Cambridge, UK. 
In July 2018 I graduated from the University of Manchester with a joint honours masters in Maths and Physics (MMath&Phys).  

I've been working full time in the video game industry since September 2018. 
I currently work at Frontier Developments, where I have experience in both engine and gameplay development.

# Development Experience
Most of my work is in **C++** but I also use **Lua** for high-level scripting.
Outside of work I've dabbled in **Python**, **C#**, **html and css**, and use of the **Unity** engine for hobby projects. 

Systems I have experience with include:
- Inverse kinematics systems, including solving algorithm implementation 
- Physics-driven chain simulations
- Ragdoll physics, including seamless transitions from physics-driven ragdolls back into authored animation poses
- Animation blend trees
- Compiler development for animation resources 


## Dev Diaries and LiveStreams
I love talking about my work! Here you can find some of the dev diaries and livestreams that I've been featured on doing just that:

## Other Interests

Outside of work I play roller derby for my local league, and I'm a keen crafter. I like to sew and knit clothes and plushies, I've dabbled in candle making and embroidery and yarn spinning - basically I just like to make things.
